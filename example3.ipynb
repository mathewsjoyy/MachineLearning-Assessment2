    "\n",
    "One of the most commonly used distance metrics is the Euclidean distance. The Euclidean distance between two points in the Euclidean space (also known as $L_2$ norm) is defined as the length of the line segment between those two points. For example, if we have two points in 2D space (i.e. two samples consisting of two features), $\\mathbf{x}_0 = \\{x_{0,0}, x_{0,1}\\}$ and $\\mathbf{x}_1 = \\{x_{1,0}, x_{1,1}\\}$, we can calculate the distance as:\n",

    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, we need to calculate the difference between the first features of the two samples, the difference between the second features of the two samples, then square each of the differences, sum those squares, and calculate the square root of the resulting sum.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, when we are dealing with points in nD space (corresponding to samples with n features) of the form $\\mathbf{x}_i = \\{x_{0,i}, x_{1,i}, \\dots, x_{n,i}\\}$, the procedure is very similar. To calculade the Euclidean disatnce, you need to calculate the difference between the corresponding features of two samples, square each of the differences, and calculate the square root of the resulting sum:\n",

    "#### YOUR ANSWERS:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Accuracy measures the proportion of correct predictions out of all of the predictions made and can be misleading if the distribution of classes is imbalanced. Precision checks how many positive predictions were truly positive – a high precision likely means the classifier will make fewer positive predictions but with a higher degree of confidence. Recall measures the proportion of true positive predictions out of all the actual positives. Recall is a measure of sensitivity where it will make more positive predictions but with a higher rate of false positives. Cohen’s Kappa is a good measure where there is class imbalance and measures agreement between the classifier and true values.\n",
    " \n",
    "Other metrics that could be used include F1 Score, Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), or Gini Index. F1 Score is a mix of precision and recall and can be used to combine the two into a single value metric.  RMSE is an alternative for accuracy where deviation of predictions from the true values is measured. Gini Index is mostly used in decision trees and it is a representation of variance.\n",
    " \n",
    "For reporting I would like to include all the calculated metrics as that data is important in some way and shows how well the classifier is working. The most important metric, in my opinion, is accuracy. Accuracy, as simple as it is, shows the overall effectiveness of the model – a higher precision is useless if the accuracy is low. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. With a very large volume of data the Decision Tree will have a higher memory usage as the tree itself as the tree has to be stored. Whilst many distances in KNN are also stored, this would work out to be less than the Decision Tree. KNN has no training time O(1) whereas a Decision Tree is O(n^2). KNN will take a long time to reach a decision (O(n)) as all points must be considered, whereas a Decision Tree will reach a decision in O(log n) time – this is due to the Decision Tree generalising the data in the fitting stage. This means for a single query KNN will produce a faster result whereas for multiple queries a Decision Tree would be faster long term after the initial fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Data normalisation helps to clean the data and express it with a similar distribution across the board. I would expect the accuracy of for both to increase as there are a couple of larger values within the datasets that could overwhelm the Euclidean distance calculation; for example, the volume within the batteries dataset and the three hill shade values within the forest cover dataset where all of these values are over one hundred whereas other values within the datasets are less than one. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. An 80:20 training/test data split is common in machine learning tasks where one considerable drawback is that the performance of the models can be highly dependent on the specific split of the data; datasets with some infrequent classes or outliers then fitting the model to the data may produce unwanted results. A better evaluation strategy is k-fold cross validation or go even further and use leave-one-out cross validation. In leave-one-out cross validation, instead of using k folds, the data is used to train the model one time for each item in the set, using all other items as a training set and only one item as the testing set. This will give a model performance metric which is more robust to outliers in the data."
